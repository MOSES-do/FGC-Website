                        Lord, Our Refuge
                    </h3>

                    <!-- <small class="name">by Victor Adeyemi on September 5, 2022</small> -->

                    <p class="text">Psalm 46:1 contains a description of God and a wonderful promise based on His
                        character:
                        <br>
                        “God is our refuge and
                        strength, an ever-present help in trouble.”
                        In Psalm 46, the poet describes various kinds of disasters and the chaos that marks our
                        existence in
                        this broken and
                        sinful world. He alludes to natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, and
                        floods, but through it
                        all, “we will not fear”. The various distresses the psalmist lists are an occasion to take note
                        of God’s help. He is our
                        refuge, our strength,
                        and our ever-present help in troubled times. In the hardships of this life, we find safety and
                        rest
                        in God.
                        <br> <br>
                        The world is
                        unstable, but “the city of God”—His habitation—is established and secure (Psalm 46:4–6). No
                        matter
                        what happens in this
                        world, God will be exalted, and those who are His will ultimately be safe (verses 10–11). We can
                        “be
                        still and know”
                        that He is God (verse 10).

                <article>
                    <div>
                        <img class="article-img" src="./images/article-2.jpeg">
                        <h3 class="article-sub--title">
                            Lord, Our Strength
                        </h3>
                        <p class="text">The structure of Psalm 46 is beautiful. Verses 2 and 3 along with verses 8 and 9
                            describe disasters and trials. But
                            verses 1, 4–7, and 10–11 describe God’s power and safety in the midst of those difficulties.
                            So
                            the trouble is bracketed
                            by God’s promises; the verses about the difficulties of life are graphically “surrounded” by
                            verses about the power and
                            safety of the Lord. This is an amazing picture,
                            <br> <br>
                            Like a mother or father who hugs and comforts a fearful and upset child, God surrounds us
                            and
                            protects us in our
                            difficulties. Note that the psalmist doesn’t state that God will remove us from the
                            difficulty;
                            rather, God will protect
                            us and glorify Himself in the midst of the difficulty.
                            <br> <br>
                            He is our refuge. God provides safety. We take shelter in our relationship with Him
                            (Proverbs
                            18:10).

                            He is our strength. God gives us the power we need to endure hardship as we serve Him, fight
                            spiritual battles, resist
                            temptation, and bear up under persecution. We are weak, but He is strong (2 Corinthians
                            12:10).
                            <br> <br>
                            He is an ever-present help in trouble. God is at hand. He is not far away from us but nearby
                            to
                            assist us in the tasks
                            He has assigned (cf. Psalm 145:18).

                            Lord, Our Peace
                        </h3>


                        <p class="text">
                            True peace will not come until we are with the Lord in “the city of God, the holy place
                            where
                            the Most High dwells”
                            (Psalm 46:4). This means that, in this world, we may experience hurt, and, eventually, we
                            will
                            die. But in the midst of
                            it all, God is working everything out for good (see Romans 8:28). For those who belong to
                            God,
                            even the bad stuff has a
                            good end! We are eternally safe...
                            <br> <br>
                            The ultimate goal is to exalt and glorify God. This is the purpose of your life. As you rest
                            in
                            His protection during
                            the difficulties of this life, you are showing the goodness and power of God. Thus, no
                            matter
                            what happens, trust Him.
                            Even if things don’t seem to turn out as you would like, remember that you are not home yet.

                            Because God promises to be our refuge and strength, we do not fear. Because He is an
                            ever-present help in trouble, those
                            who belong to Him can commit their way to Him and take their rest. God is saying, “Be still.
                            Trust me. I’ve got this.”

                            Have you been saved by God through believing in the death and resurrection of Jesus for the
                            forgiveness of your sins and
                            eternal life? Can you truly say, “God is my refuge”?
